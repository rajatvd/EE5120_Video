# Matrix Completion using the Nuclear Norm and Low Rank Factorization
## EE5120 Course Project (Jul-Nov 2018)

This repo contains python code for implementing the ALM optimization algorithm described in [this paper](http://printart.isr.ist.utl.pt/ICCV13_NuclearNorm.pdf) (Algorithm 1 in the paper) for matrix completion using the nuclear norm.
